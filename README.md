# Tic-Tac-Toe
This Tic Tac Toe Player uses minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.
'X' and 'O' is randomly assigned to the player and the AI. 'X' will go first.

The board is a 3x3 grid where the player need to input which position of the grid they want to place their piece.

For Example,

I want to place my X in the middle. I will input 2,2. The AI will then followup with its own action.

To win the game, either the player or the AI have to get their pieces to line up. Else, it is a draw.
